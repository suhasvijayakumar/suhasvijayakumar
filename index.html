  Hi there,
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm Suhas Vijayakumar, a physicist-turned-neuroscientist currently working as a post-doctoral fellow at the <a href="https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/evolutionaryneurosciencelab/home">Evolutionary Neuroscience Lab</a> of Harvard University.
  I recently completed my PhD from Radboud University in the Netherlands (at the Donders Institute). For someone who always ran as far as possible from anything biology, this conversion rather happened unexpectedly and I talk about it briefly here:

  While during the day I work towards understanding what makes human brains different from that of the other animals, and what changes accompany learning and skill acquisition, I like to think about science communication, education, and technology by night.
