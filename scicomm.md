I am in strong favour of promoting public understanding of science and believe it to be particularly relevant in a developing country like India, where a career in science is often looked down upon. I want to communicate science, alongside pursuing scientific research, through jargon-less scientific writing, talking and teaching. Here are some samples.

## Webinar: Human brains are special. Are they really?
I was invited to give a public talk at my alma mater St. Joseph's College, Bengaluru, India. Again, keeping with the norms of 2020, it was a webinar, and I tried to talk both about the kind of research I was engaged in, as well as generally why I find brains fascinating. At duration `24:20` in the following video, I start talking about some of those fascinating features like:
- Synesthesia
- Attention blindness
- Plasticity (ability of brains to change)
- Anton babinski syndrome (where people who cannot see, claim that they actually can!)

## Radboud talks 2019
[[news]](https://www.ru.nl/english/research/vm/radboud-talks/) | [[Youtube]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg9CTsQv-ZWYCUtr1UppiibXYKSZVXSOb)

**Radboud talks** is a 3-minute pitch competition where researchers from all disciplines
narrate their research stories for live audience and a jury of science communication experts. No presentation slides, no charts and graphs, just story.

I ended up winning the 2019 competition for which, I received 1000 euros as personal science communication budget. Here's my pitch during the preliminaries.

## Neuro Nuggets (a YouTube series)
It's easy to get occupied in doing research and not stop to enjoy the process. So, I started making a series of YouTube videos about how researchers got interested in the field of neuroscience. While I hope neuroscientists find these interesting, I also hope that someone stumbling upon one such video might find the field absolutely fascinating too.

Below are two example stories in which, I talk to

## Blogposts
Every now and then, I try to write blogposts about concepts that I find interesting. One such post about how flawed of planning can be, appeared on Donders Wonders blog.

On planning fallacy: [Things always take longer than expected. Always.](http://blog.donders.ru.nl/?p=6958&lang=en)

I also jot down my thoughts on my own blog: [metadata](/blog/)
