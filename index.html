  Hi there,
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm Suhas Vijayakumar, a physicist-turned-neuroscientist currently working as a post-doctoral 
  research fellow in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tobergmann.de/">Neurostimulation Group</a> of 
  Prof. Dr. Til Ole Bergmann (University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University 
  Mainz, Germany). Previously, having obtained a PhD for studying the "Principles of parietal-frontal 
  cortical organization" under the supervision of Dr. Rogier Mars and Prof. Dr. Pieter Medendorp (Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands), 
  I worked as a postdoc in the Evolutionary Neuroscience Lab of Dr. Erin Hecht at Harvard University. 
  </p>

  You would be right to wonder how physics, evolutionary neuroscience, and neurostimulation fit together. 
  These conversions rather happened unexpectedly and I talk about the first one (physics to neuroscience) in this video:

  While during the day I work towards understanding how we could use low-intensity focused ultrasound to modulate neural activity, 
  I like to think about science communication, education, and technology by night.
