## Cover page of my thesis
A good friend of mine, **Monalisa Sethi**, made this brilliant cover art for my thesis cover page. I used this artwork to also make the invite (which doubles as a bookmark). [[click here]](https://www.behance.net/monalisasethi) to find her other artwork on behnace. I highly recommend it.[^1]

## The defense
In case you're curious about what a PhD defense looks like in the Netherlands, you can see mine below. Because of everything that happened in the year that shall not be named[^2], it had to happen over Zoom. But you'll get the general idea.

## The post-defense party
Immediately after the defense, with the help of my amazing paranymphs, I had a chance to virtually host an online party over at [gather.town](https://gather.town/). Its main advantage over other video call services is that it has a virtual map in which you could move around using arrow keys. But your audio and video get "connected" to only those people in your vicinity on the map! I spent a couple of hours making this custom map so that people could either hangout at dedicated spots with people they already knew, or they could go into this _"adventurous" common room_ where they'd potentially meet new people. It was total chaos in the beginning, but eventually, once things settled down, it was a lot of fun.

If you'd like to wander around that map[^3], it still exists. <a target="_blank" href="https://gather.town/app/r2VHMalSSXmjZsrQ/Suhas's%20postdefense%20party">[click here]</a> or on the map above to open it in a new tab.
